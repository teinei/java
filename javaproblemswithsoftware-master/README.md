# Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software
The assignments from Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software on Coursera

## Solving Programming Problems: A Seven Step Approach
1. Work Example By Hand
  - Solve small instance by hand
  - Unclear problem?
  - Need domain knowledge?
2. Write Down What You Did
  - Write down exact steps
  - Just that instance
  - Tricky: do without thinking
3. Find Patterns
  - Algorithm for any instance
  - Find patterns
  - Repetition, conditions, values
  - Difficulties?
    * Try step 1 + 2 again
    * Different inputs
4. Check By Hand
  - Incorrect pattern? Find now
  - Check with different inputs
5. Translating To Code
  - Programming language
6. Run Test Cases
  - Run test cases on code
  - Check anwser
7. Debug Failed Test Cases
  - Test failed? Debug
    * Use scientific method
    * Understand problem + fix
  - Algorithm problem?
    * Return to step 3 and fix the algorithm
  - Implementation problem? 
    * Return to step 5 and correct the translation of the algorithm to code
