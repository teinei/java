/**************
 * 
 * Can I say, THIS ALGORITHM DOES NOT WORK WELL???
 * 
 * Algorithm to identify multiple genes in a strand of DNA
 * 
 * To find the first gene, find the start codon ATG.
 * Next look immediately past ATG for the first occurrence of each of the three stop codons TAG, TGA, and TAA.
 * If the length of the substring between ATG and any of these three stop codons is a multiple of three, 
 * then a candidate for a gene is the start codon through the end of the stop codon.
 * If there is more than one valid candidate, the smallest such string is the gene. 
 * The gene includes the start and stop codon.
 * If no start codon was found, then you are done.
 * If a start codon was found, but no gene was found, 
 * then start searching for another gene via the next occurrence of a start codon 
 * starting immediately after the start codon that didn't yield a gene.
 * If a gene was found, then start searching for the next gene immediately after this found gene.

	 * 2 divide all bases following the start codon into 3-base codons
	 * 3 check each codon to see if any codon is equal to "TAG", "TGA", or "TAA"
	 * 4 if we get any hit, then that first hit is the stop codon
	 * 5 return the index position of that stop codon
	 * 6 if no stop codon exist in this "frame", then return -1 as the stop codon position
	 * 
	 * example: GAATGACTGATAGATATGCTTGTA
	 * 1 locate the start codon ATG at index 2
	 * 2 divide and formate the frame: GA-ATG-ACT-GAT-AGA-TAT-GCT-TGA-A
	 * 3 the TGA in the end is the stop codon
	 * 4 return the index of TGA: 20
