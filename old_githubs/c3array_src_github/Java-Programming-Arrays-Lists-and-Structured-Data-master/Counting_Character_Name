# Write a program to determine the characters in one of Shakespeare’s plays that have the most speaking parts. 
# Note that each speaking part is at the beginning of the line (there may be some blanks before it) and has a period immediately following it. 
# Shakespeare used this format in many of his plays. 
# Sometimes the name of the person to speak was all capitalized and sometimes it was not.

# Write a program to print out the main characters in one of Shakespeare’s plays, those with the most speaking parts. 
# You should identify a speaking part by reading the file line-by-line and finding the location of the first period on the line. 
# Then you will assume that everything up to the first period is the name of a character and count how many times that occurs in the file. 
# You will only print those characters that appear more often than others. 
# Notice our method is somewhat error prone. For example, a period is also used to indicate the end of a sentence. 
# By printing out only those characters that appear a lot, we will get rid of most of the errors. 
# Periods that indicate the end of a sentence will likely be a unique phrase so you won’t print that as it would just occur once or maybe twice.
