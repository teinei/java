Here are some optional ideas to extend your program even further:

* **Test edge cases.** 'Edge cases' refer to special situations where a program might break down. For example, consider searching for names that don't exist at all on the list of baby names provided, or only appear in some years but not in others. What happens when you try to find the most popular decade for such a name?

* **Use a different set of data.** Does your home country record a similar set of data? Try finding a similar but different set of data and modifying your program to work with it. What changes do you have to make with the new data set? What are the similarities? How might those similarities and differences affect how you would write a program that used data from every country in the world?

* **Explore different statistics.** If you wanted to know the median rank for a name over a period of multiple years, rather than the most popular year in that span, how would you write your program? What about finding a list of all the names that were used for fewer than 10 children in a particular year? What about finding the most popular name and year in the entire data set from a short list of your friends and family names? What are your own ideas for discovering interesting facts from this data set?

* **Adapt your program to a new problem.** This project focused on reading data from CSV files, which is a common data storage format. Try adapting your baby name program to do something new. For example, you might be a teacher with a gradebook of student test results; you could use your program to find the average scores for each test. Or you might run a business and have accounting records; you could find your most profitable month over the last two years of operation.

Whatever you do to extend your program and solve new problems, share it with us and your peers in the forums! Happy programming!
