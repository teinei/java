/**
 * This assignment is to find all the genes in a DNA string.
 * Algorithm to identify multiple genes in a strand of DNA
 * To find the first gene, find the start codon ATG.
 * Next look immediately past ATG for the first occurrence of each of the three stop codons TAG, TGA, and TAA.
 * If the length of the substring between ATG and any of these three stop codons is a multiple of three, then a candidate for a gene is the start codon through the end of the stop codon.
 * If there is more than one valid candidate, the smallest such string is the gene. The gene includes the start and stop codon.
 * If no start codon was found, then you are done.
 * If a start codon was found, but no gene was found, then start searching for another gene via the next occurrence of a start codon starting immediately after the start codon that didn't yield a gene.
 * If a gene was found, then start searching for the next gene immediately after this found gene.
 * Note that according to this algorithm, for the string "ATGCTGACCTGATAG", ATGCTGACCTGATAG could be a gene, but ATGCTGACCTGA would not be, even though it is shorter, because another instance of 'TGA' is found first that is not a multiple of three away from the start codon.
